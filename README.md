# MATLAB-Real-Time-Edge-Detection

The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of built-in MATLAB edge detection functions and compare them with a custom implementation of the Canny edge detector that processes live video from a webcam in real time. The Canny algorithm, known for its robustness and accuracy, was chosen for deeper analysis and adaptation due to its flexibility through parameters such as threshold values and Gaussian filtering.

By implementing and testing a custom Canny detector, the project explores potential improvements over standard methods and examines how different parameter settings influence edge detection performance. The evaluation includes analysis of various performance metrics — such as recall, precision, F1-score, and processing time — to provide a comprehensive insight into the efficiency and reliability of each algorithm.
